            <p>"What should my book club read next?" is a site for when you need to find a good book to read.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you know the genre, or you have an author in mind, or just a basic theme--go to the <a href="book-search.html">book search</a> to see what Google Books finds for your search! Or maybe you have no idea where to start and just want the latest--or not the latest--popular fiction or nonfiction out there. Head over to the <a href="bestseller-search.html">bestseller lists</a> to find New York Times bestseller lists for the date of your choosing.</p>
            <p>Either way, if any of the results interest you, just click on it to see some more info at a glance. How well-rated is this book? (Don't want your book club to be reading any duds.) How many pages is it? (There's only so much time between club meetings.) If it still tickles your fancy, click "More Info" to find it on Google Books, and even get a head-start on reading!</p>
